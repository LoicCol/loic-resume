# My Resume

[Live version](https://loiccol.github.io/loic-resume/)

This project is a web-based version of my resume, built with Vite, React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my skills, experience, and projects in a modern and interactive format.

## Features

- Dark mode: The resume has a dark mode that can be toggled on and off. The dark mode state is saved in local storage, so it persists across sessions.
- Animated transitions: The resume uses `react-spring` for smooth and natural animations.
- Responsive design: The resume is designed to look good on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
